The command `make USE_PGXS=1 installcheck` fails with 'could not open extension control file "/usr/share/postgresql/9.6/extension/jsquery.control": No such file or directory'.

I've decided to unbundle the commands in the `install-pgsql-jsquery.sh` script and execute each one in the ansible playbook so I can more easily see which command is failing.

Getting `Peer authentication failed for user` when issuing `psql --username=ethercis`. Ref this https://stackoverflow.com/a/28783632[SO answer] it works.
